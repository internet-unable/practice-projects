## My process
### Built with
- Responsive design approach
- Vite
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- React
- CSS Modules

### What I learned
"Recipe page" - is a responsive, single-page project with simple components.

I tried to think of this page as a part of some larger project (for example, a recipe website) and prepare components in such a way that it would be easy to quickly assemble a similar page.

In the end, I got:
- several UI components (Card, Divider, Heading, List, Table)
- all of them have a certain set of prepeared styles (to look like on the mockup). I use ```rem``` units for font sizes, paddings and margins. That allow me to make responsive page, just by changing ```font-size``` for ```html```.
- I added a configuration option for some of the components, through the ```props```, ```className``` or ```styles``` (depending on the component)

### Continued development
As a next step, I'd like to develop more complex project, with opportunitie to use advanced React techniques (state, hooks, context/redux, etc.) and 3-rd party libraries (Tailwind CSS, React Router, etc.).
